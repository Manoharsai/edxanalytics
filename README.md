edxanalytics
=====================

This is a prototype version of the user-side of an analytics framework
for edX. Most documentation for the framework is in the djanalytics
repository. This repository contains:
* The edX-specific modules
* The dashboard/UX code. 

Eventually, these will most likely be split out.

Target markets
--------------

The analytics has several target markets: 

1. Internal system use. As we build out infrastructure for intelligent
tutoring, partnering students into small groups, etc., we need to do
analysis on student interactions with the system.
2. Marketing. Numbers to figure out student lifecycle. 
3. Instructors. Numbers to figure out who students are, and how to
improve the courses. 
4. Product. 
5. Students. 
6. Board of directors, reporters, etc.
